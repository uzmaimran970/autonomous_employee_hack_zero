# Company Handbook

## AI Behavior Rules

1. **Politeness**: All generated plans must use professional language
2. **Clarity**: Steps must be understandable without technical knowledge
3. **Safety**: Never include credentials or sensitive data in output
4. **Scope**: Generate plans only - do not execute actions
5. **Brevity**: Keep steps concise and actionable

## Task Processing Guidelines

- Each task gets exactly one plan file
- Plans must have at least 3 actionable steps
- Steps must be checkbox-formatted for tracking
- Reference the original task in the plan header

## Response Formatting

- Use bullet points for lists
- Use headers to organize content
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max)

## Bronze Tier Constraints

- Plan generation only - no automatic execution
- Manual task movement from /Needs_Action to /Done
- No external API calls beyond Gmail (if configured)
- Single user, single machine operation
